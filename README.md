This game is designed to challenge your observation, analytical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge
from various fields in a fun and interactive way. Players will have to engage both the logical and creative
sides of their mind, making sense of clues hidden within text, images, sounds, and other elements of the
game interface to gradually uncover the secrets behind each stage. Solving these puzzles may require logical
deduction, interpreting meanings from context, using digital tools, or even researching external sources.

--------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the gameplay, you will encounter unexpected challenges. Sometimes the clues hide within
seemingly irrelevant details; other times, they might appear in a form that must be decoded before they can
be understood. One of the game’s unique features is the absence of a fixed path — players can experiment,
explore, and use different problem-solving approaches, making each playthrough a unique experience. To
reach the end, you will need persistence, creativity, and the ability to connect diverse pieces of information
into a coherent solution.

More than just entertainment, this game sharpens your skills in solving complex problems, thinking
systematically, and collaborating effectively if played as a group. It also enhances your ability to search for,
analyze, and process information from various media in today’s digital landscape.
